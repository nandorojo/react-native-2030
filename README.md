#  React Native 2030

On May 12, 2023, I gave [a talk called React Native 2030](https://www.youtube.com/live/1WnmFqImedY?feature=share&t=28058) at App.js Conf in Krakow.

This repository will be three things:

1. A checklist of all the items mentioned in the talk, with links to any relevant conversations, tweet threads or implementations.
2. A place to discuss the React Native 2030 vision in [discussions](https://github.com/nandorojo/react-native-2030/discussions)
3. A repository where actual source code lives. 
  a. For example, if we implement a userland `html.div`, we can host the source in this repository, either as a pseudocode snippet, or as a real package with an example app.
  
TODO

- [ ] Add checklist (lol)
